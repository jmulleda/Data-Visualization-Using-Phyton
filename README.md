## Background 

Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in large data sets.

## Objectives

-	To effectively communicate information in a universal manner using visual information
-	To pinpoint areas that need to be improved or need more attention
-	To help organizations in increased understanding of the next steps that must be taken
-	To help audience absorb information quickly, improve insights and make faster decisions

## Stretch goals and future lines of work

Data analysis and visualization have grown to become an integral part of the business realm that governs many aspects of our lives in this modern-day and age. Emerging technologies like machine learning, augmented reality, virtual reality, and AI play a more significant role in effective data visualization.
